# Book "Anatomy of the 4040 Disk Drive" by Hilaire Gagne

This repository tracks the reconstruction of the book "Anatomy of the 4040 Disk Drive" by Hilaire Gagne.

> This book provides a complete description of the Commodore 4040 dual floppy drive.  The book covers file management, data management disk management, file organization, advanced disk programming, hardware and  software interfacing, RAM and  ROM disassembly, and application examples.

**The book contains a full commented disassembly of "CBM DOS V2.1" for the 4040.** (The original source is available at [https://github.com/mist64/cbmsrc](https://github.com/mist64/cbmsrc/tree/master/DOS_4040).)

It was written with an unknown word processor, probably on a Commodore PET, and the original files were part of the [estate of Dennis Jarvis](http://6502.org/users/sjgray/dj/). The conversion code in Python does a pretty good job converting the original files to HTML. Some tags/commands in the source files are skipped.

The [resulting HTML](html/anatomy-4040.html) was checked into this repository and cleaned up.
